<h1>SSRI</h1>
<img src="SSRI.png">
<p>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a class of drugs that are typically used as antidepressants in the treatment of major 
    depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and other psychological conditions.
    SSRIs increase the extracellular level of the neurotransmitter serotonin by limiting its reabsorption (reuptake) into the presynaptic 
    cell.[2] They have varying degrees of selectivity for the other monoamine transporters, with pure SSRIs having strong affinity for the 
    serotonin transporter and only weak affinity for the norepinephrine and dopamine transporters.
    SSRIs are the most widely prescribed antidepressants in many countries.[3] The efficacy of SSRIs in mild or moderate cases of depression 
    has been disputed[4] and may or may not be outweighed by side effects, especially in adolescent populations.</p>
